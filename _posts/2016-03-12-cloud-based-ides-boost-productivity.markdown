Today, thanks to cloud computing, most people have instant access to information, tools and applications that can help them perform their corporate and personal tasks better.

That’s not the case, however, on the development side: Nearly 15 million developers and software companies use traditional development environment, with all of the limitations that come with operating systems for developing applications and software. They code, compile and debug applications while sitting in front of a system that supports the given development environment or IDE.

<h2>Problems with OS and desktop-based IDEs</h2>

In today’s agile market, developers have to keep up with the coding, compiling and debugging activities, and release software/applications by a given deadline. Desktop/OS-specific IDEs can impede the development process and potentially cause missed deadlines; because they do not give developers the flexibility and autonomy to work anytime from anywhere.


OS / desktop-based IDEs can also be a problem when an application or software program is a joint effort of many developers - amendments and the management of releases is difficult because different developers have worked in their system-specific IDEs.


It’s imperative in fast-paced, competitive business environments for developers to find a coding environment that is free from the challenges of specific OSes and machines

<h2>Advantages of working in cloud-based IDEs</h2>

Using an online or cloud-based development environment unlocks the following benefits for software developers and software development companies, boosting productivity and Return of Investment(ROI)


- Programming workspace is a single and centralized environment in which multiple people can co-build, co-edit and co-debug.
- Easy and instant access to code and libraries through the web.
- Enables developers to work on the go without the need to occupy systems with loads of heavy code and data.
- Accessible through all devices and browsers.
- Facilitates better collaboration among developers located at different locations.
- Reduces duplication of work



There are several cloud-based IDEs available that can take your coding and application programming task to the next level.

One of the best, among the list is Cloud9, which has a free user plan, enough for professional developers. In the free plan you will have one free private workspace and unlimited public workspaces. Also there are paid plans starting from $19/month, which provide unlimited free private workspaces.

Regarding usability, it’s pretty fast to handle most of the regular development tasks like as in our local environment with a console. Cloud9 combines a powerful online code editor with a full Ubuntu workspace in the cloud. It supports more than 40 languages, with class A support for PHP, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Go, which helps in building WordPress, Django and Rails websites and test in 300+ browser/OS combinations.
